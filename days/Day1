Prompt engineering
The process of providing inputs to generative AI models to specify the responses the model can produce. 
In-context learning
Another term for prompt engineering, where examples are provided to guide the model. 
Fine-tuning
The process of tweaking an AI model's parameters to improve its performance. 
Adversarial prompting
The process of testing a model's resilience against challenging inputs to identify areas where it may produce incorrect or biased outputs. 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
A technique that uses retrieved information to enhance a model's performance in tasks like question answering and text generation. 
Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
A technique that allows large language models (LLMs) to solve a problem as a series of intermediate steps before giving a final answer. 
The 4S method
A framework that uses the principles of Simplicity, Specificity, Sensitivity, and Structure to enhance the effectiveness of AI applications.
